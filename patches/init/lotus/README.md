> Emitting a harmonic meditation ðŸª·

_Lotus_ is a rich binaural oscillator patch, named after the Lotus flower which symbolizes spiritual 
awakening and harmony. It's connection to meditative practices can loosely be connected to the dual-frequency
harmony of binaural beats.

|----------|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **CV_1** | Tune      | The leader oscillator's running frequency (100-400Hz)                                                   |
| **CV_2** | Detune    | The speed of the binaural beat, detuning the follower oscillator within 20Hz from the leader oscillator |
| **CV_3** | LFO Rate  | The speed at which the follower oscillator changes frequency                                            |
| **CV_4** | LFO Depth | The amount in which the LFO rate affects the follower oscillator's frequency                            | 
| **B8**   | Sync      | Syncs the two oscillators together when turned on                                                       |
