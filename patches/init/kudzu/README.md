# Kudzu

Kudzu is an expressive distortion patch, named after the invasive vine that 
grows incredibly fast and smothers other plants, trees, and buildings.
It folds, twists, and mangles audio for a sometimes unrecognizable outcome. 

## Controls

| Control  | Name       | Description                                                                               |
|----------|------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **CV_1** | Drive      | The amount of signal boost before distortion is applied.                                  |
| **CV_2** | Tone       | The coloring of tone from a simple high/low-pass filter before or after the signal.       |
| **CV_3** | Symmetry   | The polarity in which the distortion is being applied.                                    |
| **CV_4** | Mix        | The blend of dry (original) and wet (distorted) signal.                                   |
| **CV_5** | CV_1 Input | CV input for CV_1 (Drive).                                                                |
| **CV_6** | CV_2 Input | CV input for CV_2 (Tone).                                                                 |
| **CV_7** | CV_3 Input | CV input for CV_3 (Symmetry).                                                             |
| **CV_8** | CV_4 Input | CV input for CV_4 (Mix).                                                                  |
| **B8**   | Algorithm  | The algorithm that will distort the signal (up = **Saturation**, down = **Wavefolding**). |
