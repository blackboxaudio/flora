# Kudzu

> Twisting audio like nature's fastest invader ðŸŒ¿

Kudzu is an expressive distortion patch, named after the invasive vine that 
grows incredibly fast and smothers other plants, trees, and buildings.
It folds, twists, and mangles audio for a sometimes unrecognizable outcome. 

## Controls

| Control  | Name       | Description                                                                              |
|----------|------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **CV_1** | Drive      | The amount of signal boost before distortion is applied                                  |
| **CV_2** | Tone       | The coloring of tone from a post-saturation low-pass filter                              |
| **CV_3** | Symmetry   | The blend between symmetric and asymmetric distortion.                                   |
| **CV_4** | Mix        | The blend of dry (original) and wet (distorted) signal                                   |
| **CV_5** | CV_1 Input | CV input for CV_1 (Drive)                                                                |
| **CV_6** | CV_3 Input | CV input for CV_3 (Symmetry)                                                             |
| **CV_7** | CV_2 Input | CV input for CV_2 (Tone)                                                                 |
| **CV_8** | CV_4 Input | CV input for CV_4 (Mix)                                                                  |
| **B8**   | Algorithm  | The algorithm that will distort the signal (Up = **Saturation**, Down = **Wavefolding**) |
